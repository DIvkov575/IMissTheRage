Runs on Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect 

Compatible with Macos (can be made compatible by changing char code of meta key (0x08) to Ctrl (find it yourself in USBKeyboard.h)

Some Notes
- Aruino RP2040 is an arduino board based on rasberry pi's RP2040 Microcontroller (which was a huge pain to work with because everything is written for ATMEL)
- Aruino RP2040 has an IMU unit (Acceleromter)
- Aruino RP2040 has native usb ðŸ¤²

- Rage threshold is adjusted with 'threshold' variable
- Requires the Arduino_LSM6DSOX library (installable via arduino IDE)
- Arduino_LSM6DSOX readGyroscope and readAccelerometer seem to swapped, hence readGyroscope usage
